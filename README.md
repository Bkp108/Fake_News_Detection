# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to detect **fake news articles** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. A dataset of 45K+ news articles was preprocessed and classified into **fake** or **real** categories.  

## ⚙️ Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization using NLTK  
   - TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Achieved ~98% accuracy on test data  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 📊 Results  
- Logistic Regression performed best with ~98% accuracy.  
- Visualizations of word distributions and model performance included.  


## 🚀 Future Work  
- Implement deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)  
- Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit
